</ol><p>The major part of this project is image processing and devising an algorithm to detect and count number of vehicles.</p><p>The software that was used was codeblocks for C++ with opencv.</p><p>Through image processing, we calculated the number of vehicles plying on road in real time. We had preset the levels of density as high,medium and low. The counted number of vehicles were matched with the levels and the duration of traffic signal was set accordingly. Less than 10 vehicles was categorized as low, 10-30 as medium whereas number of vehicles greater than 30 was high vehicles density.</p><p>The functions that were primarily used are:</p><p>1) Background subtraction(GMG)</p><p>2) Morphological operators.</p><p>3) Finding contours.</p><p>4) Drawing contours and bounding them.</p><p>5) Finding area of contours. </p>
