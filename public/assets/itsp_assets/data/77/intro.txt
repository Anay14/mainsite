<p style="text-align: center;">We plan to make a mechanical model of the popular chess game.The chess playing robot can receive commands from the user and move the piece on it's own using an arduino and a couple of motors. It also will be able to think on its own and  make a move to counter that of the player's.The AI part is<br>based on Negamax algorithm and Alpha-beta pruning.</p>
