<p>The whole project was executed using image processing.We used the OpenCV library along with Python to implement the idea.</p><p>The image input is taken through the webcam connected to the PC.Each frame coming in is processed.Firstly the image is thresholded using Otsu threshold.The background of the image must be uniform and dark in colour.The user must also use wear surgical gloves of any light colour.</p><p>The contour surrounding the hand is obtained.Using functions like convexity hull the finger tips are obtained and thus number of fingers raised is calculated.</p><p>A database of template images was created.This database was converted into text files by just writing the contour of the template images into the text file.</p><p>All the signs were classified on basis of the number of fingers raised in that sign.</p><p>The comparison of the real time symbol with the template symbol was done ion a three step process.Initially the contour were compared to find the 5 closest matching templates.Then the polygons were compared to  find the 3 closest matching templates.Finally contours were again compared to find the best matching sign.</p>
