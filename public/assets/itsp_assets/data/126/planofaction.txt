<ul>
<li>bot design ready </li><li>arduni coding learned </li><li>figured out the communication serial to communicate with the bluetooth device </li><li>bought parts </li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned :
<ul>
<li>completing the mechanical parts</li><li>starting electrical parts </li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What we achieved:
<ul>
<li>mecahanical  part completed </li><li>bought some of the parts too</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?<ul><li>completing the  electrical part </li><li>bot should start </li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>as suggested in the review meet the circuit must be clean </li><li>so started optmising the circuit </li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?<ul><li>bot must start</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>the last pain was that the battery was not able to give proper current to the bot </li><li>thought of adding a additional  battery to  compensate the current loss</li><li>the bot started . </li></ul></li></ul>
