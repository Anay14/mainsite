<p>We had planned to make a skateboard which will have two different sensors for controlling speed and direction separately. The basic idea of the project was to use ultrasonic sensors for controlling the speed and piezo sensors for turning the skateboard in the desired direction. The ultrasonic sensor would be on the front side of the skateboard which would measure the distance of our hand from it and accordingly change the speed of the skateboard. The piezo sensors would take pressure difference applied by our feet as the input and accordingly help in turning the skateboard.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_04svRX09kbazRDakpRY3BOaGs&amp;authuser=0" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/0.jpg" alt="Ultrasonic Sensors" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></a></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/1.jpg" style="width: 255px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" alt=""></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/3.jpg" style="width: 251px;"></p>
