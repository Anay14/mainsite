<p>We are building a bot which can be controlled by gestures of hand. It can go forward as well as backward avoiding the obstacles. It can also turn at any angle, depending on the time of tilt using differential mechanism. We are using two DC motors operating between 5-12 volts at a maximum speed of 300 rpm, it is also controlled by the angle of inclination of hand(controlling device). It also beeps when it gets a wrong command, eg. command to move towards an obstacle.</p>
