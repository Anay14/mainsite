</ol><p>1.Robotic motion</p><ul><li>Forward motion:The robot will move one step during each loop of arduino code.The bot will move by a sideways mechanism.The mechanism foe its locomotion is described below-</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">a)One of the foot servos,say left,will tilt the bot a little,and after that the right foot motor will rotate to lift the left leg in air.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">b)The lifted servo will then rotate in such a way that the larger surface of both the servos will be parallel.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">c)With the left leg lifted,the right hip servo motor will rotate to bring the lifted leg forward.We have attached a thin rubber sheet at the bottom of  feet to ensure that the robot's feet do not move in the reverse direction,due to insufficient friction.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">d)After that the left servo will become free in order to bring the lifted leg on the ground.The rubber sheet also ensures that the robot does not jerk during this process.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">e)Now the robot has moved its left leg forward.By repeating similar such steps,it will move forward.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="http://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/1/2/6/4/5/6/t5474331-12-thumb-IMG_0756.jpg?d=1358992156" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;">Problems Faced:</p><p>Since all the aluminium clamps used were handmade they were not exactly alike. We planned on using one servo to tilt two motors. Hence with one servo the motors did not rotate by 90 degree simultaneously. Hence this mechanism could not be used.</p><p>Model 2:</p><br></div>
<div>Problems Faced:</div><div>To inrease the strength of this mechanism we had to use small pieces of ply which increased the weight of the plane. The big compartments used in this mechanism also decreased the exposure value of propellers. Hence the 4 motors were not able to lift up the plane. </div><div>Model 3:<br><br>
</div><ol>Problems Faced:<br> Since the whole body was handmade it was unsymmetrical. The plane was not stable in hover mode </ol>
