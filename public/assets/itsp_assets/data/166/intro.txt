<p><strong>When people drive while they are tired, drowsy or sleepy, this is commonly referred to as “driver fatigue” or drowsy driving. </strong></p><p><strong> Fatigued car drivers often have a difficult time perceiving and processing information. For instance, a driver may not recognize that he or she has drifted into 
the wrong lane until it is too late, and a serious car accident happens.</strong></p><p><strong>
In order to prevent these devastating accidents, the state of drowsiness of the driver should be monitored.</strong></p>
