	<span style="font-family: Arial;">Our project, <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> is a gaming controller which enables the user to play Counter Strike. The gaming controller has 3 parts, a head mount, a gun and a headphone. Various buttons are fitted on the controller at appropriate places which act as controls for the game. The head mount has 2 USB ports and one audio port which is to be connected to the PC via appropriate cables. Also the head mount has a slot for an android phone which is connected to the PC via USB for streaming the PC display on the phone applying binocular rendering. Appropriate lenses are also fitted, giving the user a 3D visual effect. The visuals, the gun and the first person perspective of the game, is the reason the user imagines himself inside the game in virtual reality.</span></p><p>
