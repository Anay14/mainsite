</ol><p>     The bot has 2 big wheels and a caster wheel that are the only contacts with the ground while moving normally on the ground.As soon as the bot comes in contact with a step, we provide a fourth contact i.e, the rubber stud. This stud is attached to the case's bottom   </p><p>As mentioned before, the basis for our bot is purely mechanical. As the pinion rotates, the rack is pushed back, this provides the main thrustforce required for the bot to move up<img src="http://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/1/2/6/4/5/6/t5474331-12-thumb-IMG_0756.jpg?d=1358992156" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></p><p><img src="http://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/1/2/6/4/5/6/t5474332-78-thumb-IMG_0754.jpg?d=1358992156"></p><p>Problems Faced:</p><p>Since all the aluminium clamps used were handmade they were not exactly alike. We planned on using one servo to tilt two motors. Hence with one servo the motors did not rotate by 90 degree simultaneously. Hence this mechanism could not be used.</p><p>Model 2:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_EoRfX4KBD8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OmetQEKIyfk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<div>Problems Faced:</div>
<div>To increase the strength of this mechanism we had to use small pieces of ply which increased the weight of the plane. The big compartments used in this mechanism also decreased the exposure value of propellers. Hence the 4 motors were not able to lift up the plane. </div>

</div><ol>Problems Faced:<br> Since the whole body was handmade it was unsymmetrical. The plane was not stable in hover mode </ol>
