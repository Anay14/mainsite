</ol><p>Accelerometers are used to detect the motion of the fingers which in turn will help in the cursor movement accordingly.</p><p>We are using Arduino Leonardo to generate data due to the movement of the glove. Arduino Leonardo has specific functions related to mouse which will help us in our project.</p><p>Further, we are using push buttons to click.</p><p><strong>Problems Faced:</strong></p><p>We have coded for the movement of the cursor but its not working smoothly. It works well and good for sometime and then the cursor moves constantly towards one direction even if the accelerometers do not move. Moreover, the sensitivity of the accelerometers is not pretty good.</p><p>Further, we will also be using a power supply such as a power booster or just an external battery (whatever suitable), to make our glove wireless.</p></div><ol><br></ol>
