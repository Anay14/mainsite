<p>The concepts required in this project were more based on the different modules we used. One needed quite an understanding of the Communication protocols, and of basic C++ coding to create different classes and implement a sizable code.</p><p><strong>Problem Faced During Development -</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><ul>
<li>Ethernet Shield – Arduino shield uses SPI interface from ISP connector . </li><li>Problems after creating server using Wamp – Port 80 was not working on Windows, since it was being used by other program, so connection had to be shifted to port 8080 (any other port other than 80 could be used). Also firewall settings are changed. </li><li>With Visual Micro –Latest version of Visual Micro with latest Arduino IDE 1.6.4 had bugs. </li><li>Fingerprint Sensor – Adarfruit Library uses the array size of ‘packet’ undefined (auto set) causing the runtime errors on Arduino Mega by resetting it.</li></ul>
