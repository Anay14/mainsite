	The bot must give a tough time to the human player and try its best 
to win/draw the game. If the human plays perfectly, lose the game after 
maximum number of moves (when Bot is second player). The bot must play 
according to the difficulty level set by the player.

	The project is aimed at equipping us with the basic rudimentary knowledge of a variety of issue specific skills. Through the implementation of the project we would be learning the basic skills of image processing, electronics and mechanical mobility. We will also be learning more about coding algorithms (MinMax) which we will be using to execute our designs.
