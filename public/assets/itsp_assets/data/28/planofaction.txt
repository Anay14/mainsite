<h3>May 6-11</h3><h4>Planned:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">     1. Decide on a heuristic function. Code the AI part of the project.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Decide on exact blueprint of the project(with mentor). Order the required components.</p><h4>Accomplished:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Decided on a heuristic function and wrote preliminary connect4 code.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Decided on the components required for the project (only motors, ICs, Arduino and basic electronic components)</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><h3>May 12-17 </h3><h4>Planned:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Work on Image Processing using OpenCV. Also explore IR/Laser for finding the position/state of the game.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Parallelly, improve on the initial working AI code and making it 
more efficient and addition of features such as difficulty level, hints 
etc.,.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3. Complete integration of the AI with the IP/IR code.</p><h4>Accomplished:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Worked on Image Processing using OpenCV. Preliminary IP code ready. Also explored IR for finding the state of the game.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. AI code improved to increase depth of search, hence code is much faster than before.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3. Bought various components required for the bot. ( except mechanical frame parts)</p><h3>May 18-23</h3><h4>Planned:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Work on the electronics module, to control the mechanical components(motors etc.,.). ( This also involves learning about the electronics module )</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Complete the structural setting of the bot(using the components that arrived).</p><h4>Accomplished:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Completed checking of the servo and the stepper motors. The coin dispensing mechanism worked.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Completed designing a 3D model of the frame to hold the motors and the conveyor belt.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><h3>May 24-29</h3><h4>Planned:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Integration of all 3 components(AI, IP, elec.) by making suitable changes in code and suitable changes in the bot.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Debugging and further improvements introduced.</p><h4>Accomplished:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Worked further on IR, but couldn't do much work.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Integration of AI with IP completed. Also integrated AI with the electronics' code.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><h3>May 30-June 4</h3><h4>Planned:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Further Improvements.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. Final Presentation.</p><h4>Accomplished:</h4><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Bought all components for mechanical frame/support.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2.  Completed integration of all 3 major components.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3. Working model of project made.</p>
