the mechanical assembly was equipped with flex
sensors and accelerometers.</p><p>Flex sensors-They are analog resistors. They
work as analog voltage dividers. Inside the flex sensors are carbon resistive
elements within a thin flexible substrate (more carbon means less resistance).When
the substrate is bent, the sensor produces a resistance output relative to the
bend radius.</p><p>Thus bending of flex sensors which are
attached rigidly to the fingers of our glove will rotate the respective servo
and consequently will give the motion to the finger of our mechanical arm.</p><p>Accelerometers-An <strong>accelerometer</strong> is a device that measures proper acceleration("g-force"). Proper acceleration is not the same as
coordinate acceleration (rate of change of velocity). </p><p>Some smartphones, digital audio players and personal digital assistants contain accelerometers for user interface
control; often the accelerometer is used to present landscape or portrait views of the device's screen, based on the way the device is being held.</p><p>Thus, when they are tilted
they give different output values which are then synchronized with the servos
and consequently produces motion. We are using accelerometers for controlling
the palm’s and elbow’s motion.</p><p><img src="http://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/1/2/6/4/5/6/t5474331-12-thumb-IMG_0756.jpg?d=1358992156" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></p><p><img src="http://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/1/2/6/4/5/6/t5474332-78-thumb-IMG_0754.jpg?d=1358992156"></p><p>Problems Faced:</p><p>Since all the aluminium clamps used were handmade they were not exactly alike. We planned on using one servo to tilt two motors. Hence with one servo the motors did not rotate by 90 degree simultaneously. Hence this mechanism could not be used.</p><p>Model 2:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_EoRfX4KBD8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OmetQEKIyfk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
