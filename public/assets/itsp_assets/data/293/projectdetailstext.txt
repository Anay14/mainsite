<p>We initially thought of making the bot first but realized that we might need to make structural changes to the bot. so we first started with the back end programming. Initially we had no clue how the Arduino would work so we first wrote simple programs to get ourselves acquainted to the Arduino. Step by step we progressed and got acclimatized to Arduino. This took us about a week or so. We then started our research on the actual project. We had divided the project into sub parts and decided that it was important to do voice processing first. </p><p>//add about voice processing</p><p>After we had initiated ourselves into voice processing we side by side started on image processing. We have been able to recognize a square and our working on being able to recognize other objects.</p><p>                //thinking of adding the slides from 2nd rev meet which give a compact view of what we have done</p>
