<p>This project was inspired by the need of hasslefree wireless communication and automation of machines. The robot provides a medium for executing basic voice commands and enables visual access to even remote places. This can be developed further for wider applications like wireless voice operations to some fixed system, like Jarvis!! The bot can be easily used as it only takes voice inputs for command execution. </p>
