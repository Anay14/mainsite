	<p>The main concepts of our project are as follows:</p><p>1. A switchboard is constructed which replaces the standard switchboards in the house for simple establishment of the home automation system.</p><p>2. Switchboard consists of an Arduino Micro-controller which controls the state of the switches through commands given via the Android app or also manually using external switches.</p><p>3. It is also connected to relays, which are in turn connected to the AC connections to the respective appliances. Thus, the electrical appliances can be controlled easily by the Arduino.</p><p>4. The Android app will have a two-way control with the Arduino via Bluetooth or Internet.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">For the Bluetooth transmission, we will be using the Bluetooth module (HC-05), which will be connected to the Arduino</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">For internet transmission, we will be using direct ethernet connection</p><p>5. Te andriod app will have a feedback system to update the state of switches continouosly in the app.</p><p>6. For control via voice commands we are planning to impport the android app libraries from the internet thus including the voice processing in our app.</p><p>Problems Faced:</p></div><ol><br></ol>
