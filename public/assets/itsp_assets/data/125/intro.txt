<h5>We had planned to make a <strong>quadcopter</strong> which will have two modes <strong>obstacle avoider mode</strong> and rc mode. The basic idea of the project was to design a quadcopter such a way that it will avoid any obstacle whether it be dynamic or still obstacle.What we did is simply disconnected two receiver channels(<em>i.e. aileron and elevator </em>)  and signalled them using arduino which was  receiving the information about obstacle using IR sensors . </h5><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/0.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/1.jpg" style="width: 255px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" alt=""></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/3.jpg" style="width: 251px;"></p>
