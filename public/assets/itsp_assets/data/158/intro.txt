<p>We had planned to make something that could harvest heat energy and convert it into electrical energy. Then we thought why not utilize the heat energy we radiate. We came up with the idea of making a flashlight that will glow from the heat of hand without any external power supply.  We humans are great source of uncharged energy. So it would be amazing to create a flashight powered solely from the heat of hand.</p>
