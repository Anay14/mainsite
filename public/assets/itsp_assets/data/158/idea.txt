<p>If we can capture enough heat from a human hand and convert it efficiently to electricity, then we can power a flashlight without any batteries or kinetic energy.</p><p> An average human dissipates around 350,000 Joules per hour, or 97 watts. The average surface area of the human skin is 1.7 m<sup>2</sup> or 17,000 cm<sup>2</sup>, so the heat dissipation equals to (97/17000) * 1000 = <strong>5.7 mW / cm<sup>2</sup></strong>. <br>A useful area of the palm is about 10 cm<sup>2</sup>. This implies that 57 mW could be available.<br>The thermal efficiency of a Peltier tile is cited at about 10%.  This means that we should be able to generate 5.7mW in the palm of the hand. We knew that we needed at least 0.5 mW to obtain usable LED brightness. </p><p>PELTIER TILES:A semiconductor device which utilize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect">thermoelectric effect</a>. When a temperature difference exists across a material, charge carriers will start to diffuse from hot to cold. The separation of charges causes a potential difference across the material. The term "thermoelectric effect" encompasses the "seebeck effect" which is the conversion of temperature differences directly into electricity.</p>
