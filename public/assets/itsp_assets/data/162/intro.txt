<p>We had planned to make a accelerometer based mouse with which one can move the cursor just by tilting the device. The device will  be mounted on a glove, which means you can wear it. There will be 2 buttons for left mouse button and right mouse button. One can move the cursor left/right by tilting their hand in that direction or they can move it up/down by tilting their hand in front or back direction. The device will function as a normal mouse.</p>
