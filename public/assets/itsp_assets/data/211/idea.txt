We, then, decided to make use of rack and pinion mechanism. It consisted a shaft with a linear bearing moving on it. A housing was made to hold the stepper motor along with the bearing. The stepper motor moved on a rack giving rise to the motion of the plank as shown in the picture. </p><p>Model 2:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_EoRfX4KBD8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OmetQEKIyfk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<div>Problems Faced:</div><div>The motor driver which we used was L298N. According to the internet videos we referred to , we had to connect the raspberry pi pins directly to the driver inputs and the stepper motor to the driver output. But this gave rise to very high current being drawn in the circuit , which was giving undesired results. We had to then connect high resistors in series with the output to limit the current. Also , we could not keep two pins high at the same time leading to the same issue, hence, we decided to keep only one pin of the raspberry pi to be high at one point of time.</div><div>Model 3:<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5HJ5QXE1sdM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>Problems Faced:</div><div>SOCKET PROGRAMMING</div>
