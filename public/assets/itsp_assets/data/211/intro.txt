<p>We had planned to make a chess bot which allows two players to play chess over the internet. The basic idea of the project was to that the first person plays a move on his board and this move is recognized using image processing and sent over the internet (using wi-fi) to the location of the second player. Then, that move is played automatically on his board and the game continues. </p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/0.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/1.jpg" style="width: 255px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" alt=""></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/3.jpg" style="width: 251px;"></p>
