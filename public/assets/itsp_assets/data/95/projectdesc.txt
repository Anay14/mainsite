<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">PepperShield is an augmented pepper spray to be used as a device for self defence in the event of a
criminal attack on the individual. Motivated though it is by the need for a defence mechanism to
counter the rapid rise in crimes against women, especially in India, it can be used by any individual for
protecting oneself or another person under the circumstances of a criminal attack.
The device is provided with a camera which takes a picture of the attacker at the moment the
deterrent spray is released. The device then sends the photograph to the victim’s cellphone via
Bluetooth and triggers the sending of an SOS message to preset emergency contact numbers, along
with the victim’s current location tracked through GPS.</span></p>
