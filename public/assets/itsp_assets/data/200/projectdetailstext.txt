<ul><li>In
     this project a person on reaching his home will send message to the GSM
     module a code. </li>
 <li>The
     GSM module will supply the message and phone no. to the
     microcontroller ie Arduino which will then verify whether it is from the
     owner or not.</li>
 <li>If
     it is from the owner then it will activate the door unlocking procedure
     which involves the Arduino supplying power to the door motor via a Mosfet
     and Relay to turn on the motor for a specific time which will then unlock
     the door via a rack and pinion mechanism. </li>
 <li>There
     is one pair of Lazer LDR sensor outside and another pair inside the door. The
     outside one is sensor 1 and the inside one is sensor 2.</li>
 <li>When a person enters the room he first crosses
     sensor 1 then 2. The LDR in presence of Lazer light gives a constant Analog
     Reading of 1023 however when the person passes the reading drops to 700 to
     900.</li>
 <li>The Arduino has been programmed to detect changes
     in sensor 1 when its reading drops below 1000 and subsequently wait for 2
     secs and withing that time if the second sensor reading also falls below
     1000 then there is a counter which counts the no of persons entering the
     room and it increases as one by one persons enter the room. </li>
 <li>There is a LM-35 temperature sensor that is set
      at 24 degree celsius. If the
     temperature is below 24 then only light is turned on else both fan and
     light is turned on automatically as soon as one person enters the room and
     an sms is sent to his mobile if he wishes to turn on or off light fan or
     close the door according to his convenience.these things can be done from
     any mobile phone as long as at least one person is inside the room.</li>
 <li>However when the last person leaves the room
     the door locking mechanism gets activated and hence the room locks
     automatically. The room unlocking can only be done from a particular phone
     only belonging to the owner of the house and if anybody else tries to open
     it a warning message would be sent to the owner supplying him with the phone
     no. of the person trying to open the house.</li></ul>
