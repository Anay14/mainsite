				<h2>Vision of Club</h2>
				<p>
					Students after coming to IIT and studying engineering tend to forget why they were fascinated by math and physics in their childhood and why they chose it. The documentaries, scientific phenomena happening around and interesting chats with elders were those things which had attracted us in our childhood towards our current field of studies. The aim of the club is to bring back that feeling of fascination inside students by showing them similar interesting scientific phenomenon and discussing about them in experimental demonstrations, lectures and group discussions. People should regain their enthusiasm about learning physics and mathematics and should like to come again and again in scientific gatherings for the same. There are many such facts which need college level understanding and are yet unexplored; We just need to start scratching the surface.
