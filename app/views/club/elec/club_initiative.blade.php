     <div>
     	<h3>What is it?</h3>
     	<p>Ever been to a Hackathon? This is the Electronics equivalent of that. Take a few ICs, a few more transistors, add the magic of code and make something awesome within a given time frame.</p>

     <div>
     	<h3>Motivation?</h3>
     	<p>Why should 'Coders' have all the fun?<br>
			We were not impressed by the fact that only coders get to enjoy the thrill of a Hackathon. <br>
			What about the Electronics enthusiastic people? <br>
			So we decided to take up the responsibilty of conducting a <b>Hardware Hackathon</b> the IITB way.
