										<h1 class="post-title">Astronomy Demystified</h1>
										
										<p>we kicked off the journey by a lecture delivered by the former manager of the club, Ruturaj Atre. An enthusiastic crowd of around 40 students, mostly UG and PG freshmen, attended the lecture.</p>

										<p>First he introduced the club and its events and then moved on to cover many interesting topics like the evolution of astronomy and science as such over time. Then he skillfully generated the awe of the basic phenomenons that happen around us like the lunar eclipse. All through the lecture he showed us how some very basic experiments were used to prove some complex theories like heliocentric system and to find some essential parameters just by observing at the right time. He also supported the existence of the astronomical events as they are written in the Mahabharata. </p>
										
										<p>Towards the end, he elaborated about the astro-photography research internship he had taken up at TU Braunschweig, Germany.</p>
										<p>I thank the conveners of the club - Pavan, Vivek, Nirish, Vishnu, Ahilan, Naitik and all those who came for making this event successful.</p>
