<h1>Smart Campus Challenge</h1>
<p>
We currently live in the "Smart" age. From mobile phones to TVs, vehicles to surveillance equipment, everything is getting faster, smoother and smarter. Automation is the future. So why not do the same with our campus? 
</p>
<p>
IITB is currently the frontrunner for India in producing world class technical innovations and solutions for the betterment of society. Even then, if you walk inside the campus, you hardly see anything tech-y around, that people are using to ease their interaction with the campus facilities in general. The only thing as of now that separates us from the vast array of engineering colleges in India is probably a few solar cells here and there, a smart greenhouse and a few other discrete technical equipments here and there. Is that it? Is that what weâ€™re stuck on?
</p>
<p>
And so, we have decided to make our home i.e the IITB campus smarter, greener and more efficient. 
</p>
<p>
We recently circulated a form around, asking people about their ideas on how to do this. The result we got was mind blowing, with nearly 200 people pouring in their thoughts!
</p>
<p>
	The primary motivation is to encourage students to come up with novel technical solutions and implement to day to day problems which they face inside the institute. We never had shortage of ideas but somehow they are never implemented to a scalable product. <b>SSTeP</b> is a platform where we will generate ideas, work in team to make prototypes and validate it in a weeks time with the help of expert mentorship from the associated professionals from well-established firms like <b>Arduino India, Texas Instruments</b> and successful start-ups like <b>Humming Whale, Leaf Techonologies , NanoSniff</b>. The final aim of this weeklong event will be  turning these ideas into reality. The final work will also be judged by the associated firms and prizes will be distributed.  So register yourself and you may be a part of the team working to make campus a better place!
